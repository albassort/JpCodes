In July 1872, the first Minister of Education, Oki Takata, a pro-
gressive yogakusha who believed strongly in the necessity for script
simplification, set Tanaka Yoshikado (1841-89) and Otsuki Shilji
(1845-1931) the task of compiling a selection of the characters used
most often by ordinary people in everyday affairs. The result oftheir
deliberations was a two-volume dictionary, Shinsen Jisho (A New
Dictionary), which contained 3,167 characters.

Paring down the number of Chinese characters came about initially through the Ministry of Education. In 1887, the Jinjo Shogakko Chogen (Preparatory Remarks on Elementary Schools) set the number to be used in primary-school textbooks at 2,000, a state of affairs which lasted until 1900, when the Shogakko Rei Shiko Kisoku (Rules for the Enforcement of Elementary School Regulations) further lowered the limit to 1,200. At the same time it decreed standardization of the kana syllabaries and replacement of the historical system of kana usage with the phonetic system earlier championed by the Kana Club's Snow Faction. This last decision proved unpopular with many, and was in fact countermanded eight years later, not to be revived until 1931 when the strength of public opinion again forced its postponement. It was not until 1946 that the government, in a post-war climate of reform more receptive to orthographic change than the also reform-oriented but less desperate situation of the Meiji Period, promulgated the rules for pronunciation-based kana usage which are employed today. At the same time, the National Language Council, a body set up by the government in 1934 to investigate ways of improving the language and promoting its teaching, presented a new list of 1,850 Chinese characters (the toyo or 'currently-used' kanji list) which was also endorsed and adopted within a short time. This number was expanded to 1,945 in a 1981 revision, the present list being known as the joyo kanji (characters for general use).
